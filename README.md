Bankist is a minimalist, modern digital banking interface built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It offers a clean design along with smooth interactions and engaging animations that mimic real banking experiences—ideal for learning and portfolio purposes.

## Overview

Bankist presents a simplified yet elegant digital banking experience. The project includes:

*   Multiple sections showcasing features, operations, testimonials, and a sign-up prompt.
*   Engaging animations including lazy-loaded images, sticky navigation, section reveal effects, and an interactive slider.

## Features

*   **Smooth Scrolling:** Clickable navigation links that scroll smoothly to different sections of the page.
*   **Modal Window:** A modal for opening an account that can be opened and closed via buttons and keyboard events.
*   **Sticky Navigation:** Navigation bar that becomes fixed at the top after scrolling past the header.
